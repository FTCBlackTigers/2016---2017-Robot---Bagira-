The 2016 - 2017 VELOCITY VORTEX Robot Project.

## VELOCITY VORTEX Game
VELOCITY VORTEX presented by Qualcomm is played on a
3.7m × 3.7m (12 ft. × 12 ft.) square field with approximately 0.3m
(1 ft.) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. The field is divided
diagonally into a “red” and a “blue” side corresponding to the two
alliances. In the center of the field are two goals on a rotatable
stand called the Center Vortex. Two ramps, each with a goal,
called the Corner Vortex, are placed in opposite sides of the field.
The Center Vortex Goals and Corner Vortexes are alliance specific.
There are also four alliance neutral Beacons, two placed on each
front wall next to the Corner Vortex. There are floor markings as
well as Vision Targets placed on the field walls as reference points
for robot navigation.
Alliance-specific scoring elements for VELOCITY VORTEX are five small balls called Particles and one
large ball called a Cap Ball per alliance. At the start of a match, each alliance has three Particles available
for preloading and scoring during the Autonomous period. Each alliance can earn up to two more Particles
for use during the Driver-Controlled period by claiming Beacons during the Autonomous period.
Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second Autonomous period followed by a two-minute
Driver-Controlled period, and the last 30 seconds of the Driver-Controlled period called the End Game
which adds new scoring opportunities for robots to achieve.
